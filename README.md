## Problem

Manhattan Community Board meetings are long, complex, and often inaccessible to the public due to their length and lack of concise documentation. Important decisions and discussions can be missed by community members, journalists, and policymakers who do not have the time or resources to review hours of meeting footage or transcripts.
